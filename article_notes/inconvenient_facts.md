# Let's Kick a Hornet's Nest
## A Point-by-Point Take on Dr. Gregory Wrightstone's Inconvenient Facts


# The Facts

1. Carbon Dioxide is not the primary green house gas

2. The warming effect of Carbon Dioxide declines as its concentration decreases

3. First and foremost, Carbon Dioxide is plantfood

4. In the last four ice ages the Carbon Dioxide was dangerously low.

5. 140 Million years trend of dangerously decreasing Carbon Dioxide.

6. Our current geologic period, quaternary, has the lowest average carbon dioxide levels in the history of the earth

7. More carbon dioxide means more plant growth

8. More carbon dioxide helps to feed more people worldwide

9. More carbon dioxide means moister soil

10. Recent 18 year pause in warming despite rise in carbon dioxide

11. Carbon dioxide rose during second world war but temperature fell

12. Modern warming began before SUVs or coal fired plants

13. Melting glaciers and rising seas confirm warming pre-dated increases in carbon dioxide

14. Temperatures have changed for 800,000 years... it wasnt us

15. Interglacials usually last 10,000 to 15,000 years, ours is 11,000 years old.

16. Each of the four interglacial warming periods were significantly warmer than our current temperature.

17. The last interglacial, about 120,000 years ago, was 8 degrees Celcius (14.4 degrees F) wwarmer than today.  The polar bears survived.  Greenland didn't melt.

18. Temperatures changed during past 10,000 years.  It wasn't us.

19. Today's total warming and warming rate are similar to earlier periods

20. It was warmer than today for 6100 of the last 10000 years

21. Our current trend is neither unusual or unprecedented.

22. Earth's orbit and tilt drive both glacial and interglacial periods

23. We are living in one of the coldest periods in Earth's history.

24. Earth has not had a geologic period this cold in 250 million years.

25. The onl thing constant about temperatures over 600 million years is that they have been constantly changing.

26. For most of Earth's history it was about 10 degrees Celcius (18 degrees F) warmer than today.

27. IPCC future models overstate warming up to 3x too much

28. For human advancement, warmer is better than colder.

29. A return to the temperature at the beginning of the industrial revolution would lead to famine and death.

30. Only about 0.3 published scientists stated in their papers that recent warming was mostly man made.

31. Science is not consensus and consensus is not science.

32. More carbon dioxide implies fewer droughts

33. Higher temperature implies fewer droughts

34. Forest fires across northern hemisphere are decreasing.

35. More carbon dioxide leads to carbon dioxide fertilization, leads to more soil moisture, leads to faster tree growth, leads to fewer forest fires

36. More carbon dioxide in atmosphere means more food for everyone.

37. The Earth is becoming greener not turning into desert.

38. Growing seasons are lenthening.

39.  More carbon dioxide and warmer weather mean more food production.

40. EPA: Heatwaves are not becoming more frequent.

41. Extreme heat events are declining.

42. Cold kills far more people every year than heat.

43. Warmer weather means many fewer temperature related deaths

44. Warmer weather prevents millions of pre-mature deaths each year.

45. More carbon dioxide and warmth means hsorter, less intense, heatwaves.

46. Number of tornadoes is declining.

47. Number of tornadoes in 2016 is lowest on record.

48. Deaths from tornadoes are falling.

49. There has been no increase in frequency of hurricanes in recent data.

50. We have seen 250 years of declining hurricane frequency.

51. No significant increase in huuricane intensity due to warming.

52.  The population of polar bears is growing.

53. There are more polar bears than we have had for 50 years.

54. Polar bears are thriving even where sea ice is diminishing.

55. No historic correlation between carbon dioxide and oceanic PH.

56. The oceans did not become acidic even at 15x modern carbon dioxide levels.

57. Sea level increase began more than 15000 years ago.

58. Recent sea level rise began 150 years before the increase in carbon dioxide.

59. Melting the northern polar ice cap would not increase sea level.

60. Most of Antarcica is cooling and gaining ice mass.
