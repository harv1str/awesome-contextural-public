Blog Ideas

0. (1) About this Thing --> This is a personality Driven Publication
    - This is about my own journey as a technologist into the world of Environmental science
	- Really, I am just trying to live up to the standards of living set by my dead father in order to flee from the spectre of his disappointment.
	- The goal is to discuss and create a nexus of action (however pointlessly self indulgent it really is) for myself and write some funny shit to get away from the dreary usual information around Climate Science)
	- No Bi-Lines as I will be discussing some really really really sensative stuff and will be  disucssing my own hypocrisy and journey from an avid consumer of stuff to someone who cares more about stuff that I dont have receipts for.
	- It's rated R.  I curse a fair bit and occationally this will come out.  Still, the content on here will still strive to adhere to the precepts of the creator's covenant and neither on any socials nor on the blog itself will any racist, sexist, abelist, or transphobic language be tolerated.  Articles with possibly sensative material will come along with a content warning as well as have a set of tags to warn about content.

26. Modeling Radiative force effects accross Greenhouse gases --> How the physics of green house gases work

27. Metagoals and endurance activism --> Setting meta goals and leveraging self interest to maintain interest

28. The sludge --> Not caring while caring
    - At the end of the day, the goal is to create a better world and support sustainable practice and legislation.  The consensus of the populace is irrelevant.
    - Legislation is paramount.  If we need to ignore democracies because of the rampant misinformation and indifference, so be it.  
	- If China becomes the leader, America will follow, if India becomes the leader, China and America will follow.
	- Journalists, scientists, and businesspeople will need to drag the political and bureaucratic-set kicking and screaming.
    - Pointless arguments about the efficacy of capitalism and attempts at injecting revolutionary politics into environmental policy is a waste of time: It's essentially like saying we have to re-build the house in order to change the plumbing.  Which, although ideal, we had our chance on that one, we have to take the paths that are available rather than wax poetic about the directions that passed.
	- We arent doing this for the people we can talk to today.  Not even our kids.  This is a generational effort.  We must be selfless.
	
29. Our Environmental Yalmuke --> Why concious citizen action DOES work
    - In the musical, Fiddler on the Roof...
    - By changing our lives to reflect the world we 'want' to live in we effectively become the prototypes for what is possible.
	- It is also a reminder that we are doing a thing. Just as the Yalmulke is a reminder that there is something above.
	- History of vegetarianism.
	- Earth is our Anatevka 
	- However, moralizing and shaming is a waste of time.  We also need to stop being afraid of hypocrisy. We are all hypocrites.  If there ever was an original sin that we were born into it is our hyper-consumerist world where every action has disproportional environmental costs.
	- ... That said, I'd prefer to look at us from a geological timescale.  We are beings of immense power of which we have only become cognisant of in the past century or so.  We are architects of our own worst nightmares but also our own dreams.  We are also stupendously young as a species.  We need to humble ourselves to this fact and accept that some of the assumptions and day-to-day routines need to change given new information.
	- In some ways, this adds a level of optimism to our inquiry here.  Our existence, up to this point is a universal experiment on this planet.  I have no doubt that we have the capacity to survive any catastrophe we can wrought on ourselves.  The question is whether we will mitigate the harm done already by reducing the suffering of our posterity, or will future generations curse our wastage and indifference as they starve and perish to repent for our sins of today.

And this is the mindset of a people who will smile and clap their way into a new paleolithic era.

	- (AL): To keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering.
	- (AL):The land is a community is the basic concet of ecology, but that land is to be loved and respected is an extension of ethics.
	- (AL): The land ethic changes the rold of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it.
	- (AL): We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us.  When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect.
	- (AL): Anything is right when it tends to peserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community.  It is wrong when it tends otherwise.

56. 10 things environmental journalists can learn from enthusiast media
    - CONTENT WARNING: This article discusses guns in a way that doesn't really exhibit my lefty politics.  This is because it is a discussion of 'how to talk about' rather than perscribing judgements of the  content at-hand.  If this is going to be offensive to you... you were warned. Here is a link to an article where I shit on Republicans for a while.

    - Media in the social media age is an engine of culture.  No longer are effete journalists sitting in a smoking room scribing and scribbling against a woodworn room against a symphony of typewriters.
	
	- Due in large part to the expansion of denialists and the proliferation of counterproductive memers and conspiracy theorists, YouTube and Google have begun filtering out community content in favor of traditional media coverage of climate oriented content.  Given the realities of automated content discovery and the fact that this is a real problem, their actions are neither unsurprising nor particularly negative.  However, this compromise also comes at reducing engagement and making finding accessible content much harder.
	
	- Environmental Science and Action is exceptionally complex (go figure) and intimidating.  
	
    - Cars (Donut Media, DriveClub, Lando Norris, Super GT) 
		* {Be Participants, Be -- uh-- enthusiastic, Cool matters }
		
	- Video Games & Technology(Waypoint, Kotaku, Giant Bomb, Jimmy Broadbent, iJustine) 
		* { Media is a springboard for Participation, Interact with the community }
		
	- Fitness (Greg Doucette, Athlean-X, Jeff Nippard, Vitruvian Physique, Jocko Wilnick) 
		* { YOU are an example, teach participation, Embrace the Suck }
		
	- Cooking (Gordon Ramsey, Rosanna Pansino, Epic Meal Time )
		* { Production Matters, Lifestyle porn is Really entertaining }
		
	- Guns (Demolition Ranch, Kentucky Ballistics )
		* { Be Funny, Compartmentalize Content }
		
	- Examples of great shit (Climate Town, Elizabeth Kolbert)
	- Culture informs what we perceive as 'real'.
	
57. Another Paradigm of consumption --> We automated pollution.  The next step is automating consumption.

58. Our Accidental Genocide --> How climate change is and will kill(ing) billions
	- The Century of Hell
	- "That we know global warming is our doing should be a comfort, not a
      cause for despair, however incomprehensively large and complicated we
      find the processes that have brought it into being; that we know we are,
      ourselves, responsible for all of its punishing effects should be
      empowering, and not just perversely. Global warming is, after all, a
      human invention. And the flip side of our real-time guilt is that we
      remain in command. No matter how out-of-control the climate system
      seems—with its roiling typhoons, unprecedented famines and heat waves,
      refugee crises and climate conflicts—we are all its authors. And still
      writing.

    - Now, just for fun, let us assume that we do nothing, we wait too long, and the global response to climate change stalls out for the next decade...

    - It will be a short period of time when the debate ends and catastrophic events become normalized.  In this sense, and it is indeed gholish to say-- but it may be fortunate that less developed countries get hit first.  The abstract witnessing of misery is a fantastic driver of people projecting into the future.  If the press-corp can report earnestly and wholeheartedly on the death, deconstruction, and misery of the people being hit hardest (which will be hard to do as island nation states begin to literally disappear and climate refugees flood into other nations).

86. /THE_POINT/ The Limits of ESG Benchmarking --> How ESG benchmarking is limited by the assumptions of its practitioners

87. /THE_POINT/ Is Finance the Answer? --> How the most powerful mechanism for modifying behavior is a key aspect of climate change mitigation
    - One of the most nefarious and harmful aspects of capitalism is its complete indifference to ideology and exceptionally high tolerance for hypocrisy.  That said, with that tolerance comes flexibility.  As anyone 
    - Here, I want to make an argument for finance and citizen finance as a critical mechanism for change.
    - This is not a scribe to espouse the benefits of a free market solution.
	- This is about the reality that 'this is how things move' in our world while extracting (admittedly, my own) ideals of green utopianism.  I love you Henry David Thoreau and Edward Abbey, but today, Mark Carney and Norman Bourlaug are my homies.  
	- The pursuit of wealth is a shibboleth in financial circles while that same pursuit is the first thing to be scorned in environmentalist communities.  This is an issue since the people who most know 'what' needs to be done are often not discussing with those that know 'how' to do it.  It is an imperative for our future that we reconcile these two social mechanisms and understand that while environmentalists and scientists may have a vision of the changes that need to be made to reduce carbon emissions (and beyond), the single biggest mover of human behavior in the world of 202x are financial markets and if the oracles fail to meet, they will carry on in their waxing and waning tendancies of destruction, conservation, and compartmentalized coalition building. A visionless cycle, only accomplishing quotidian goals until the next generation takes on the wheels and does the same.

95. Cost Modeling through Generations --> How generational problems have often flummoxed society.
    -- For this post, we are going to consider climate change as a 'human' problem.  As a point of clarification, we are not talking about the concept of 'anthropogenic' changes, rather utilizing the human timeline and historical understanding to descrive a generational problem.  Although this analysis won't be particularly mathematical or even scientific, we think it is an important mechanism for extending understanding of how we, as a species, have tackled long-term problems in the hope of fly wheeling thought.  The over all goal of this will be to induce thinking about environmental issues, not as some ephemeral abstract, but rather as a function of generational actions.
    -- Mid-Length time example: Algo Centre Mall Collapse
	-- Mid-Length time example: Centralia
	-- The natural aspect of the current velocity of climate change isn't the rise of temperature, it is the historical tendency of humans themselves.  We explore, we build, we survive.  We have also created a tangle of systems that cannot be effectively untangled without broad changes.  The primary driving variable of this change is 'time', a variable we have historically been horrifically ineffective at both conceptualizing AND acting upon.  The question, however, if we have enough time to act.
